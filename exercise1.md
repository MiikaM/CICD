The language of the project that the team uses is Rustlang (Rust). Rust is a systems development language that uses the cargo ecosystem as the basis of building, testing and package delivery for the software. For linting Rust projects there is a package called clippy, but as Rust is ahead-of-time compiled language the rust compiler (rustc) itself contains lints that can be used to lint a project.

Rust has ready-made documentation and references to multiple different CI alternatives for Github actions these include GitLab CI, which is based on the GitLab version control infrastructure that can be used as a cloud or a managed instance service. Another one is Travis CI that is a full-purpose CI tool that can be integrated with different version control systems such as Github. Travis hosts the CI workflows on their own servers to allow for more performance and independent workflows from the actual version control. 

Depending on what version control you use it is usually better to use the native CI tool for the version control system, unless you need low level control of the CI workflows, such as multi-stage testing, hardware acceleration, performance testing etc. For deciding on which is the best tool for each scenario you would need to gather more information on about e.g. the experience of the development team (do they have interest and vast knowledge of CI), working speed (how fast is the CI configurations to be modified), performance (if there is such need, in many cases the performance is good in any case), cost (what does the CI cost), integrations and version control. For simple CI choose the native CI for the version-control system (Gitlab CI, Github actions), if you need more control self hosted and dedicated platforms are good to keep in mind (Jenkins, Travic CI).
